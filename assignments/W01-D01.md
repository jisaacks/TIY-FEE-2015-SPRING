## Week 1 day 1 Homework

__Congrats! You survived your first day of class.__

In class today we made a web based invoice using several different HTML elements. Lets take this new found knowledge to create a personal resume.

Create your resume using the following HTML elements (1 or more of each):

  - `<title>`

  - `<div>`

  - `<a>`

  -  One of `<h1>` through `<h6>` (Do not need to use one of each)

  - `<img>`

  - properly formatted `<ul>`

  - properly formatted `<ol>`

  - properly formatted `<table>` with heading and body

  - `<p>`

  - `<span>`

  - `<strong>`

  - `<em>`

  - `<hr>`

  - `<br>`

Do some research and find at least 1 HTML element we did not cover today. Use that element in your resume as well.

Make sure you use all elements correctly. Make sure to format your document correctly. You can use [validator.w3.org](http://validator.w3.org/) to check your work.

If you do not wish to share personal info in your resume assignment feel free to use fake/acme data.

Do not worry about making it pretty. We are going to cover that later.

__Above all else remember this__: incomplete homework is better than turning in no homework.
